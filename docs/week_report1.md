###Week 1

Most of the time spent this week went into choosing an interesting subject for the project. I ended up choosing a random text generator as it seemed like fun and the same structure could be used for different applications in the future. The idea could even be developed further by adding some layer of interactivity to it. Something akin to a chatbot but maybe not as complicated. Other than that I focused on figuring out how the app would work in practice and what kind of datastructures would be needed for a basic version.

I am not entirely sure if the subject is complex enough as it seems rather simple on the surface.

Moving forward my first priority is to create an early version of the app. This will require some relearning of Java such as finding out how to run tests.

Time spent 2h (not counting going through all the options for the subject)
